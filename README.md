## Sailor Landing Page

This is my first time using react, a landing page for a travel company, it is a personal project, 

tools used: Figma, Milanote, React (Node.js), VS Code

It was super fun to use a Moodboard, you find my references, color palette and fonts at: <a href="https://app.milanote.com/1MLTYM1JHvCbaK?p=hErGN5E7Yd2"> Moodboard</a>

give it a like in behance ðŸ˜‰: <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/131282865/Sailor_landing_page">Behance</a>
